## About

Slate started with a pretty simple idea. I had a tablet sitting on my desk and kept thinking there had to be a better way to use it. Eventually, inspired by macro pads like the ones from Elgato, I decided to build my own! It began mostly as a learning project, but also something I actually wanted to use every day. :)
